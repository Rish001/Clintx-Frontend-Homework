# Clintx-Frontend-Assignment

As part of our application process, we'd like to see what you can produce by giving you a small assignment. Any extra polish or features you might want to put in will not go unnoticed.

## The assignment

We would like you to create an commenting app. The features it should include:

- [ ] A home page 
- [ ] A commenting page
- [ ] Add a comment button in the home page that navigates to commenting page on clicking
- [ ] Display number of comments in the home page
- [ ] Display comments in the comments in the commenting page
- [ ] Add a comment box and post button in the commenting page
- [ ] Add one layer nesting the comments e.g. in FB where you can reply to a comment
- [ ] on posting a comment, number of comments should be incremented by 1 in the home page


Your backend can be anything, and does not have to work. Static data in code is ok.
sample data structure of a comment:
{
  "user1":"lorem ipsum", 
  "children": ["user2" :"lorem impsum dolor", 
              "user3" :"lorem impsum dolor"] 
}


## Requirements

You should use the following tools to accomplish this task:
 
- React

If you have any questions, please ask!

To complete your homework, please fork this repo and commit your work to your fork. When you are ready for us to look at it, give us access to your fork so we can review and run it.
